# TreeKEA

The project description is in the file `enunqp2018.pdf` (Spanish).

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Open a console and `cd` to the directory where you extracted the source code.

2. Run

    ```bash
    > make
    ```

    to build the program.

3. This creates an executable file called `program.exe`. This executable allows you to run the program using the command:

    ```bash
    > ./program.exe
    ```
